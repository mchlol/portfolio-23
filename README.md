# Portfolio

Now that I've learned a little React I thought I'd use it to a do a portfolio refresh!  

## Outline

I'll keep the three sections but link them to other pages to practice using Router.

- Hero - this can link to an about page
- Projects - this can link to a more details projects page
- Contact - just a little paragraph and maybe some text links to the social profiles. This will also act as a footer. 

In the header I'll just have my name and aspirational job title(!) and three social media icons. Github of course and then LinkedIn and Twitter (even if I'm not using it so much right now).  

I simultaneously like and hate the idea of a video cover letter so I'll pop that in the hero once I've made one.  

## Design

There's a tip I heard in a podcast, if you're not confident in your design skills, find three interesting websites and 'borrow' a bit from each one. I might not have design skills as such, but I know what looks good to me! 
[Here's my Pinterest board for cool web designs.](https://pin.it/6bMZ9Ox)  

### I need three things:
- Layout - [I like this one](https://land-book.com/websites/33191-wonderkind-co) (I won't be copying it exactly, just using it as inspiration).
- Fonts - it would be cool to practice importing, but I think I'll start with a [display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Serif+Display) and a [sans-serif](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans) from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). 
- Colour palette - I'm going to go ahead and use ['that' colour palette](https://coolors.co/palette/a593d2-643ad9-000000-e0ff9d-f5f9e9) because it makes me laugh.  

## Images

This is a tricky one. I might use some neat [abstract images from Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/abstract) for now.  
Aside: can you find Unsplash images by colour...?  
(It might be fun to use their API to randomly generate a new image at intervals, I'll look into it.)  


## Deployment

I'll mix it up a little from using gh-pages and use Netlify again. I think it's also time to look into getting my own url.  

I'm excited! Let's get to work!
