                    <h3>What is a mchlol?</h3>
                    <p>As a teen, I ventured into web design armed with Notepad, Microsoft FrontPage, and of course GeoCities. Despite basically growing up on the computer I didn't think I was smart enough to even consider it as a career!</p>
                    <p>In my day job working in print many years later, I took over the company's WordPress site, diving into theme customization and SEO. This reignited a passion for web design,and I thought, "why not give coding a crack?" This trail lead through The Odin Project, JavaScript development at General Assembly and Scrimba's Front End Developer Career Path. Me and everyone else.</p> 
                    <p>Now knee-deep in code, I'm exploring APIs, NextJS, Node, Python, and beyond.<br />
                    I love to learn and I love the web. ü§ù </p>
                    <p>Outside the digital realm, I dabble in <em>apprendre √† parler fran√ßais</em>, font appreciation, gaming, baking and the occasional embroidery.</p>
